    ## Welcome to the Adobe Gensolve Project
    This is a multi-page web app that demonstrates different computer vision algorithms
    
    The app is divided into the following pages:
    
    1. **Algorithm 1:** Object completion using Harris Corner Detection and Symmetrical Analysis
    2. **Algorithm 2:** A page that demonstrates the Generalized Hough Transform algorithm
    3. **Algorithm 3:** A page that demonstrates the Generalized Hough Transform algorithm with multi-scale and multi-shift detection
    4. **Algorithm 4:** Shape detection and completion
    5. **Isolation and Fragmentation:** A page that demonstrates the regularization of fragmented shapes
